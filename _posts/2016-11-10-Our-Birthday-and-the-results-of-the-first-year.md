i2 team has an important target - we want to give the people what they deserved - _FREE INTERNET_ all over the world. Hard working on the realization of our dream, we have even forgotten about our birthday. A year ago, the first version of i2 Browser was launched, so what this year has changed?

- We have changed the algorithms of work with advertising systems and improved filtering of suspicious banners. Now seen ads generate more revenue per user's viewing.
- Increased stability and safety of the Internet surfing.
- We have changed the design of the site, making it more simple and understandable.
- We are working on providing support to users running sections with Frequently Asked Questions and Forum.
- We are expanding our scope - members of Russia join to the US audience! All information is available in english and russian languages.

Thank you for being with us! i2 increases, to make the world better!
